			By the way, some of you may ask where my domain name comes from. Well, my favorite card in Hearthstone is "Confessor Paletress". One day I wondered whether it had been registered as a domain name, so I searched for it and surprisingly it hadn't. So I decided to register it for my homepage. Wow, a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange">LEGENDARY</span> homepage. Coooooooooool.

			Hello everyone, I am Dai Chao, a senior student of EECS in Peking University. Recently I have learned something about Web so I decided to build a personal Web server myself, and here it is. This server is quite simple and just for learning and testing, but I'm still very happy to see you here - it really takes me some effort to make this site available to everyone. It's so exciting to be a part of the World Wide Web!

			By the way, some of you may ask where my domain name comes from. Well, my favorite card in Hearthstone is "Confessor Paletress". One day I wondered whether it had been registered as a domain name, so I searched for it and surprisingly it hadn't. So I decided to register it for my homepage. Wow, a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange">LEGENDARY</span> homepage. Coooooooooool.

			Hello everyone, I am Dai Chao, a senior student of EECS in Peking University. Recently I have learned something about Web so I decided to build a personal Web server myself, and here it is. This server is quite simple and just for learning and testing, but I'm still very happy to see you here - it really takes me some effort to make this site available to everyone. It's so exciting to be a part of the World Wide Web!

			Some of you may ask where my domain name comes from. Well, I play Hearthstone and my favorite card is "Confessor Paletress". One day I wondered if this domain name had been registered, so I searched for it and surprisingly it hadn't. Then I decided to register it for my homepage. Wow, a legendary homepage. Coooooooooool.

			By the way, I'm feeding these hamsters and dogs in my homepage. Feel free to play with it and give them food.

			Hello everyone, I am Dai Chao, a senior student of EECS in Peking University. Recently I have learned something about Web so I decided to build a personal Web server myself, and here it is. This server is quite simple and just for learning and testing, but I'm still very happy to see you here - it really takes me some effort to make this site available to everyone. It's so exciting to be a part of the World Wide Web!
